# Python-Programs

Below are the list of python programs I have worked on.

1. PrimeNos PrimeNumber Generation
  
    The program lists all prime numbers less than 3000. (A prime number can only be divided evenly by 1 and itself.)

2. Fizz Buzz

    The program prints numbers from 1 to 100 with the following exceptions -

	    For multiples of three prints “Fizz” instead of the number.
	    For the multiples of five prints “Buzz”. 
	    For numbers which are multiples of both three and five prints “FizzBuzz”.

3. Pig Latin

	  Pig Latin is a game of alterations played in the English language game.

4. Horoscope Reading
	  
    This program takes in the user input of Zodiac sign and gives the daily horoscope of the sign. It uses Beautiful Soup to get the data 	  form Astrology.com

5. Credit Card Validator using Luhn Test
    
    The Luhn test is used by some credit card companies to distinguish valid credit card numbers from what could be a random selection of     digits.
